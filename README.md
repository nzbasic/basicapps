My Website

This website is no longer online. The osu tracking capabilities can be found on [osutracker.com](osutracker.com)

The main feature is my osu stats hosting, I obtain data from the osu api in my server, (see other repo) and use canvas-js to render the data as a line graph. 

Example:\

I also combine stats for all active top players in New Zealand as seen here:\

Additionally, there are some JS apps (only viewable on desktop) that I have made over the past 2 years
So far:

Minesweeper,
Pathfinder,
Reaction Game,

All of the apps use jQuery.
